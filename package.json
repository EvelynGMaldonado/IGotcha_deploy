  "description": "## Description This project was a culmination of all of the lessons learned throughout the bootcamp. Building this project challenged us to be creative, inovative and to persevere against adversity. We used new technologies that we were not familiar with to design a platform to offer and find home services. Our app, IGotcha, allows a user to create an account so that they can list their skills as services for others to hire. Users are also free to search for a service they may need. The results correspond to the zip code of the service provider and the same search parameter entered by the user.  ## Table of Contents (Optional) If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need. - [Installation](#installation) - [Usage](#usage) - [Credits](#credits) - [License](#license) ## Installation The app can be found through this [GitHub repository]() and it has been deployed on Heroku. Click [this link]() to open the deployed app. ## Usage The user must start by signing up, which creates their user profile. Then, they can edit their profile to provide a picture and a bio of themselves. The user then has the choice of searching for services or posting them. Having one profile is enough to search and post services. ## Credits Credits go to the UW Bootcamp Instructional Staff and Tutors for teaching us the necessary skills to develop this application. Credits also go to the [Apollo-GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) and [React](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) documentation.  ## License ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) MIT License",
